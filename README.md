## Install and run

For better experience please install and use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).

```sh
$ nvm use      # to set proper node version
$ npm i        # to install dependencies
$ npm start    # to run project on localhost:3000
```

## Note

- API is fake.  It exists only to simulate asynchronous operations.
- Simple styles.  My focus was on React and task requirements and I'm not a designer.
- There are no tests.  Shame on me.
- Total time spent around 16h 30m.
